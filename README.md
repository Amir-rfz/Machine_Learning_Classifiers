# Machine Learning Classifiers

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of various Machine Learning classification models. It walks through the process of preparing and exploring data, engineering features, and building models to classify data effectively.

The workflow highlights practical skills in working with Machine Learning frameworks and understanding the strengths of different classifiers.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes multiple features that describe entities for classification tasks, such as:
- **Categorical Features**: Text-based attributes converted to numerical values.
- **Numerical Features**: Normalized or standardized for better model performance.
- **Target Variable**: Categorized labels based on thresholds derived from the data.

---

## Project Workflow
The project is structured into the following phases:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Conduct initial exploratory steps to understand data distribution.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use visualization techniques (scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.) to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
- Extract key insights to guide feature selection and model design.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Transform categorical features into numerical values.
- Generate additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Normalize or scale numerical features to suit Machine Learning models.

### 4. Model Implementation
Train and evaluate the following classification models:
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **AdaBoost**
- **XGBoost**

Optimize hyperparameters using methods like `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using metrics such as:
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Weighted and Macro-Averaged Scores
- Accuracy

Compare results to identify the best-performing model.
